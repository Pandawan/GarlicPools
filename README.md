# Garlic Pools
A dynamic (React) website with list of garlicoin pools & their data

## TODO
- Make the link redirect to a /pool/:id page instead of pool link
- Make a working/good /pool/:id page
- Change the percentage of hashrate from using total pool hashrate, to actual total hashrate (current one does not account for solo miners)
- Make an about page
- Make everything look good and interactive on both mobile and desktop
